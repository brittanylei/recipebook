# recipebook

Recipe Book is a web application to manage your recipes. You can add recipes via a form that includes common properties such as ingredients, directions, and time needed. You can view all of your recipes neatly on the main recipes page or by customizable categories. When it's time to cook, you can easily preview and view the recipe you want on your device.

The backend for this application is made with Django using a SQLite database. The app is deployed with Heroku and can be accessed at https://blei-recipebook.herokuapp.com/
